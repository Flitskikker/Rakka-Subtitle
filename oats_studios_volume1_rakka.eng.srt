the wounded, ma'am.

185
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,739
Okay.

186
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,453
It's okay.

187
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,765
I'm Sarah.

188
00:12:14,532 --> 00:12:17,403
I need to ask you
for a favor.

189
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,172
I give you food,

190
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,075
you do me a favor.

191
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,279
Okay?

192
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,751
[man groaning in pain]

193
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:54,507
It's okay, it's okay.
It's fine.

194
00:12:56,241 --> 00:13:00,379
I need to see
what it did to you.

195
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,783
It's okay.

196
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,178
<i> This world
had changed all of us...</i>

197
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:35,548
<i> but Amir had been reborn...</i>

198
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:39,552
<i> with something entirely new.</i>

199
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,423
[shouting and gunfire]

200
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,260
You see all these men?

201
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:24,530
They're going out to fight.

202
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:29,067
To try to make it
how it was before.

203
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:33,072
To stop those beasts
from doing more of this...

204
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,209
[crying out in pain]

205
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,645
What is it
with her

206
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,913
and that
fucking thing?

207
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,351
Her daughter is gone.

208
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,921
[Carl]: Everyone's daughter
is gone.

209
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,892
[Jasper]: The ones
that are experimented on,

210
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:56,695
who survive...

211
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,964
the very few...

212
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,232
Her theory is

213
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,002
it's because they have
some kind of predisposition.

214
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:06,405
They're savants of some kind.

215
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,341
And Amir is like that.

216
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,210
[Sarah]: These men are trying
to stop the genocide.

217
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,181
[Ryan]: Alpha team! Move out!

218
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:22,922
[Sarah]: They're ready
to sacrifice themselves.

219
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,124
Let's go!

220
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,561
They don't have to die tonight.

221
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,164
Help us.

222
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,765
Please.

223
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:35,367
Tell me
what futures you see.

224
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:39,604
Turn to the left.

225
00:15:39,604 --> 00:15:41,674
Incoming!

226
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,359
You can help us
turn the tide, Amir.

227
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,393
We can beat them.

228
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:03,595
[gunfire]

229
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,402
Threat down
in Fox Squadron.

230
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,270
Threat down.

231
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:16,475
All right, everyone,
triple-check those brain locks.

232
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,145
I don't want anyone
looking at it,

233
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,581
and keep out of
its line of sight, right?

234
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,629
[Sarah]:<i> What do you see?</i>

235
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,667
Do you see us
winning, Amir?

236
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:45,704
Go! Go! Go!

237
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,211
[Sarah]:<i>
Can we learn to hunt them?</i>

238
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,749
<i> Can we make them fear us?</i>

239
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,052
Go! Go!

240
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:07,125
Amir...

241
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,196
<i> Do you remember
what they did to you?</i>

242
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:15,033
<i> They do experiments
all day and all night.</i>

243
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,738
<i> They tear people apart.</i>

244
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:22,908
[gunfire]

245
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:24,007
It's wounded!

246
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:25,843
That fucking thing!
Don't let it get away!

247
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:27,746
[gunfire]

248
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,784
[Sarah]:<i> Billions die...</i>

249
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,621
<i> No one lives.</i>

250
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,389
<i> Not through that.</i>

251
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,599
But every once in a while,
a miracle happens.

252
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:52,471
One in ten million, like you.

253
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,609
<i>Someone who somehow survives...</i>

254
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:01,113
<i> Their cruelty.</i>

255
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:08,486
<i> Those things have given you
an amazing power.</i>

256
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:09,655
<i> A gift.</i>

257
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,657
<i> Beyond man.</i>

258
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:13,859
Don't look at it!

259
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,926
Look away!

260
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,629
<i> You can do the things they do.</i>

261
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,446
Put it down, Martinez!
Put it down!

262
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,719
Don't do it,
Martinez!

263
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:42,887
Don't do it!

264
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,157
[gunshot]

265
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:11,850
<i> Amir...</i>

266
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,252
<i> Please tell me...</i>

267
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:17,823
<i> What futures do you see?</i>

268
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,695
[crying out]

269
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:35,407
Cut its fucking head off.

270
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,189
Amir, it's tine.

271
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:52,824
You have to use
what they gave you.

272
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,831
<i> It's not a choice.</i>
